# Ngrok-Tunnel-Management-Project-via-Telegram-Bot
This project allows users to manage Ngrok tunnels through a Telegram bot. The bot provides a menu where users can choose different types of tunnels (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, VNC, FTP, FTPS) or stop all active tunnels. The tunnels are managed using Ngrok, and the configuration is handled through a Telegram bot that connects to the service via its API.
